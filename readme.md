# FizzBuzz Challenge

## Overview
FizzBuzz is a popular algorithm challenge that, traditionally, counts from 1 to 100 and outputs the word "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both, and just the number if it does not fight any of those three criteria!
